# Earl

A fork of [rust-url](https://github.com/servo/rust-url)
adding support for Serde 1.0 and simplifying the code base a bit.

**This is meant as a temporary thing that will be replaced by url 2.0
eventually!** Honestly, I just wanted to change stuff without many consequences.
Also, the name is cool.
